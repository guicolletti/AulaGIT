We Are The Crystal Gems
Rebecca Sugar

If you're evil and you're on the rise
You can count on the four of us taking you down
Cause we're good and evil never beats us
We'll win the fight and then go out for pizzas

We are the Crystal Gems
We'll always save the day
And if you think we can't
We'll always find a way

That's why the people of this world believe in
Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl and Steven!

If You could only know
What we really are
When we arrived on Earth
From out beyond your star

We were amazed to find
Your beauty and your worth
And we will protect your kind
And we will protect your Earth
And we will protect your Earth!
And we will protect you!

I will fight for the place where I'm free
To live together and exist as me

I'll fight in the name of Rose Quartz
And everything that she believed in

I'll fight for the the world I was made in
The Earth is everything I've ever know

I'll fight to be everything
That everybody wants me to be when I'm grown

The odds are against us
This won't be easy
But we're not going to do it alone

We are the Crystal Gems
We'll always save the day
And if you think we can't
We'll always find a way

That's why the people of this world believe in
Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl and Steven!
